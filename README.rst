Introduction
============

Transparent authentication for Strava API. This library has been inspired by
`spotifylib <https://github.com/wefner/spotifylib/>`_ as it uses a very similar
authentication flow.

The idea is to use all features and methods from `stravalib <https://github.com/hozn/stravalib>`_
but handling the authentication transparently just by providing all required
details.

It's currently written for Strava V3 API

Read more on `USAGE.rst <https://github.com/wefner/pystrava/blob/master/USAGE.rst>`_
or `Read the docs <http://pystrava.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
or check the code for substantial docstrings.
